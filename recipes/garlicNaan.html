    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This homemade garlic naan recipe is cooked in a hot cast iron skillet rather than a tandoor oven, like restaurant naan. When cooked at the proper temperature, naan develops blistered bubbles with a lovely golden-black char. Reward yourself for a job well done by sopping the bread in copious amounts of curry.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup warm water, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine water, sugar, and yeast in a bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and forms a creamy foam, about 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Heat butter in a pan over medium heat until melted and sizzling. Quickly mix in garlic and remove from the heat.
        </li>
        <li>Add bread flour, yogurt, salt, and 1 tablespoon garlic butter to yeast mixture; stir with a wooden spoon until a shaggy dough forms. Knead by hand until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl, adding more water or flour as needed. Turn dough out onto the counter and continue kneading until it forms a smooth ball, 3 to 4 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
